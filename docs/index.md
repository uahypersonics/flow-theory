# flow-theory

`flow-theory` is a Python toolkit for theoretical estimates in high-speed
aerodynamics: flat-plate skin friction and Stanton number, bow-shock standoff
and shape, entropy-layer swallowing distance, and boundary-layer transition.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
pip install flow-theory
```

### Run

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    flow-theory cf --mach 5.0 --re-x 1e7 --tw-te 0.5
    ```

=== "API"

    ```python
    from flow_theory import cf_laminar

    cf = cf_laminar(
        x=1.0,
        re1=1.0e7,
        mach=5.0,
        temp_edge=250.0,
        temp_wall=125.0,
        wall_type="isothermal",
    )
    print(f"cf = {cf:.6e}")
    ```
