## Code Style

This project follows established Python community conventions so that
contributors can focus on the physics rather than inventing formatting rules.

| Convention | What it covers | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) | Code formatting, naming, whitespace | Python standard style guide |
| [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) | Docstring structure (triple-quoted, imperative mood) | Python standard docstring conventions |
| [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) | Docstring sections (`Parameters`, `Returns`, `Attributes`) | NumPy/SciPy docstring standard — the norm for scientific Python |
| [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | Automated linting and formatting | Enforces PEP 8 compliance automatically |
| [typing / TYPE_CHECKING](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING) | Type hints for IDE support and static analysis | Python standard library |
